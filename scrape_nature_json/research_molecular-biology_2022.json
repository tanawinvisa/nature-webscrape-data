        "Summary": "Here the authors report a genomic view of 3D chromatin reorganization following DNA damage. Movement of damaged DNA into nuclear domains, which is brought about by nuclear actin, favors error-free damage repair at the expense of rare chromosome rearrangements with oncogenic potential.",
