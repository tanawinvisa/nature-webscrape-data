        "Summary": "We classically consider the T cell compartment divided into cytotoxic CD8+\u2009T cells and multiple, different helper CD4+\u2009T cell subsets. Here the authors demonstrate that distinct memory CD8+\u2009T cell subsets phenotypically inhabit CD4+\u2009T cell like populations including some\u00a0with helper-like characteristics.",

Here the authors show that, in mouse thymus, B7-CD28 differentially controls thymocyte clonal deletion and Treg induction, with distinct CD28 signaling domains and B7-expressing antigen presenting cells mediating these two processes.",
