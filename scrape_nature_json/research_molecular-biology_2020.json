        "Summary": "MiRNAs and natural antisense transcripts can both regulate gene expression and plant development. Here, the authors show that cis-NATs to MIR398 repress processing of pri-miR398 and that cis-NAT expression is downregulated at high temperatures, contributing to miR398 mediated thermotolerance responses.",
