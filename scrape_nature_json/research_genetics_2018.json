        "Summary": "Soil water uptake is a major determinant of plant performance and stress tolerance. Here the authors show that, by affecting xylem formation in the root, natural variation at the Arabidopsis XND1 locus has contrasting effects on root hydraulics and drought tolerance versus pathogen resistance.",
