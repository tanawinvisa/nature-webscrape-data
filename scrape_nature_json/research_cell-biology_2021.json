        "Summary": "To train deep learning methods to segment very small subcellular structures, the training data have to be labelled by experts as the optical effects at such a small scale and the narrow depth of focus make it difficult to identify individual structures. Sekh et al. use a physics-based simulation approach to train neural networks to automatically segment subcellular structures despite the optical artefacts.",

Here, the authors show that NuMa undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, condensing on spindle poles during mitotic entry and enriching critical components to promote spindle assembly.",
