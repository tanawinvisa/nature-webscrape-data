        "Summary": "The bacterial flagellar hook is a molecular universal joint that connects the rotary motor and long helical propeller of the bacterial flagellum. Here the authors present the 3.6 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of the native supercoiled Salmonella hook that provides insights into the dynamic changes of subunit conformations and intermolecular interactions of the hook protein FlgE.",

The authors study the dynamic adaptation of glioblastoma cells to the heterogenous brain\u00a0tumor microenvironment, showing that tumor cells demonstrate varying plasticity of their transcriptomic profiles and an ability to survive new stimuli, in part, by propagating stochastic perturbations over their gene-regulatory network.",
