        "Summary": "Uterine adenomyosis often co-occurs with endometriosis or leiomyoma, but little is known about its molecular underpinnings. Here, the authors show that KRAS mutations are frequent in this disease, which might reduce sensitivity to progestin treatment via epigenetic silencing of the progesterone receptor.",
