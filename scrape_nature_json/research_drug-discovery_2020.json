        "Link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-00598-7",
        "Summary": "134Ce and 134La have great potential as companion diagnostic isotopes for radiotherapeutics labelled with \u03b1-emitting 225Ac and 227Th. Now, by controlling the CeIII/CeIV redox couple, the large-scale production, purification and characterization of 134Ce- and 134La-based radiolabels has been achieved and their use for in vivo positron emission tomography is demonstrated.",
