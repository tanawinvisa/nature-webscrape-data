        "Summary": "Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) with undetermined mechanism of action. Here the authors find that clinical response to DMF associates with decrease in IL-17-producing CD8+\u2009T cells (Tc17), delineate molecular pathways involved, and show that DMF suppresses Tc17 pathogenicity in a mouse model of MS.",
