Here, the authors use a combination of live cell imaging and in vitro single molecule binding measurements to show that tandem calponin homology domains (CH1\u2013CH2) are sensitive to actin filament conformation, biasing their subcellular localization.",

Here the authors present a toolkit for automated design of FRET experiments, which determines how many and which FRET pairs should be used to maximize the accuracy, and for FRET-assisted structural modeling and refinement at the atomistic level.",

Cryo-EM structure of a mutant accessory subunit LYRM6 from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica and molecular dynamics simulations reveal conformational changes at the interface between LYRM6 and subunit ND3, propagated further into the complex. These findings offer insight into the mechanism of proton pumping by respiratory complex I.",
