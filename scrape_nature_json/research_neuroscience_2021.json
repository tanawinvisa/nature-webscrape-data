        "Summary": "The zebra finch robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) directs singing by providing descending projections to brainstem motor neurons. The authors show that electrophysiological characteristics of RA neurons rely on resurgent Na+ currents that emerge early during song development only in males.",

        "Summary": "Models of perceptual decision making typically take into account either reactive responses to external stimuli or proactive aspects to decision making. Here the authors found that rat perceptual responses are generated by a combination of the standard evidence accumulation process with a fixed decision boundary, and a separate stochastic boundary collapse triggered by a parallel proactive process.",

Here, the authors trained deep neural networks to estimate the fundamental frequency of sounds and found that human pitch perception depends on precise spike timing in the auditory nerve, but is also adapted to the statistical tendencies of natural sounds.",

Trpm5 is also critical in generating plateau potentials in bistable motoneurons that are essential for producing a postural tone in hindlimbs and amplifying the locomotor output.",
