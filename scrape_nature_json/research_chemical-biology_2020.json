        "Summary": "A method for the covalent labelling of proteins by installing a biostable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) tag has now been developed. The PNA label serves as a generic landing platform that enables the recruitment of fluorescent dyes via nucleic acid hybridization and fluorophore removal by toehold-mediated strand displacement. Imaging of cell surface receptors, including internalized receptors, has been demonstrated using this approach.",
