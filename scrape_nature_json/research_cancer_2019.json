        "Summary": "The progress in pre-clinical drug discovery for Wilms tumor (WT) is limited by a\u00a0lack of disease models. Here, the authors develop 45 heterotopic WT patient-derived xenografts including several anaplastic models that recapitulate the biological heterogeneity of WT, and propose this as a resource for evaluating future therapeutics for WT.",
