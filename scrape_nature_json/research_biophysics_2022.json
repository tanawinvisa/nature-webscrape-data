        "Summary": "Combining high-speed AFM, single molecule recognition force spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations Zhu, Canena, Sikora et al. characterize the interaction dynamics of the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 wt, and delta and omicron variants with its entry receptor ACE2. While delta variant increases avidity by multivalent binding to ACE2, omicron variant shows an extended binding lifetime.",

Here, authors use a combination of non-natural amino acid substitutions, electrophysiology, and molecular dynamics simulations to determine Cl\u2212 specificity within this family of ion channels.",
