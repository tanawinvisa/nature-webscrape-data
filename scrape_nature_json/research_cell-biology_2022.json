        "Summary": "Lamin A/C gene mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy associated with cofilin-1 phosphorylation and actin destabilization. Here, the authors show that phosphorylated cofilin-1 blunts the MRTF-A/SRF axis, leading to decreased tubulin acetylation and altered cardiac structure and function.",
