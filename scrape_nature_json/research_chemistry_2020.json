Now, a mechanochemical unzipping strategy has succeeded in the synthesis of a gold-coloured, semiconducting fluorinated polyacetylene with improved stability in air compared to polyacetylene.",

It had previously been stabilized in the condensed phase using two ligands, but now a monoligated L\u2192C2 complex has been prepared with a bulky phosphine ligand (L) bearing two imidazolidin-2-iminato groups. Reactivity studies and theoretical quantum chemical analysis point to the C2 moiety having a dicarbene character.",

Herein, the authors use an unsymmetric tridentate ligand to construct a Werner-type tetrahedral chiral-at-zinc complex which displays high configurational stability and catalyzes an oxa-Diels-Alder reaction with high yield and enantioselectivity.",
