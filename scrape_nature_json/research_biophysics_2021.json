        "Summary": "The complex link between protein sequence and phase behaviour for a family of prion-like low-complexity domains (PLCDs) has now been revealed. The results have uncovered a set of rules\u2014which are interpreted using a stickers-and-spacers model\u2014that govern the sequence-encoded phase behaviour of such PLCDs and enable physicochemical rationalizations that are connected to the underlying sequence composition.",

They observe an increase in the RBD-ACE2 complex stability for several of the VoCs and derive how the mutations affect the kinetic, thermodynamic and structural properties of complex formation.",
