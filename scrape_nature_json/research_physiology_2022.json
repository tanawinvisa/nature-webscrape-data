        "Summary": "Using light to optogenetically power mitochondria, this study shows that opposing the age-related decline in mitochondrial membrane potential leads to increased healthspan and lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. This result points to mitochondrial charge as a fundamental regulator of biological aging.",

Infusing C-kit-expressing LSECs in aged or diet-induced NASH mice counteracts senescence and steatosis.",

IGFBP7 promotes cardiac senescence by stimulating IGF-1R/IRS/AKT-dependent suppression of FOXO3a, and Igfbp7 deficiency or inhibition attenuates cardiac dysfunction in a pressure overload mouse HF model, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of IGFBP7 might be promising for the treatment of HF.",
