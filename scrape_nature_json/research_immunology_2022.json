        "Summary": "The developmental process of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) involves migration between different internal organs. Here the authors show that ILC2s migrate from the lung to the intestine to undergo maturation after treatment with IL-33 and that lung and intestine ILC2s have a different phenotype.",
