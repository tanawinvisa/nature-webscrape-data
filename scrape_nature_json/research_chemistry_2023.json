        "Summary": "Polyhydroxyalkanoates are potential substitutes for non-degradable polyolefin plastics. Now, it has been shown that structurally related methylated polyhydroxybutyrates, synthesized from carbon monoxide and 2-butenes, can provide a full suite of polyolefin-like polymers. These materials can be recycled or upcycled, and their properties can be easily tuned by varying the cis/trans ratio of the starting materials.",

Here, the authors report enantioselective C\u2013H activation with unsaturated hydrocarbons directed by phosphorus centres to rapidly construct libraries of axially chiral phosphines through dynamic kinetic resolution.",
