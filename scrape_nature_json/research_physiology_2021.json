        "Summary": "Sustained cardiac function depends on circadian REV-ERBs. Here, Dierickx et al. show that circadian nuclear receptors REV-ERB\u03b1 and \u03b2 are indispensable to establish the transcriptional program that controls cardiac metabolism and NAD+ production. Deregulation of REV-ERBs leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and premature death.",
