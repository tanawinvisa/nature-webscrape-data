        "Summary": "Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is the terminal stage of cancer and the current standard of care for MPE is largely palliative. Here the authors design a liposomal nanoparticle loaded with cyclic dinucleotide for targeted activation of STING signalling in macrophages and dendritic cells and show that, on intrapleural administration, the nanoparticle effectively mitigates the immune cold MPE and significantly augments the checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in a mouse MPE model and clinical patients\u2019 samples.",

Here, the authors show that LNP delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 enables repeated injections into skeletal muscle and leads to restored dystrophin expression in multiple muscle groups.",
