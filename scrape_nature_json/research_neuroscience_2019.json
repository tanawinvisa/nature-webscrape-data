        "Summary": "Pavlovian and instrumentally driven actions often conflict when determining the best outcome. Here, the authors present an arbitration theory supported by human behavioral data where Pavlovian predictors drive action selection in an uncontrollable environment, while more flexible instrumental prediction dominates under conditions of high controllability.",
