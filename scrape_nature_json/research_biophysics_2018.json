Here authors use single\u2010molecule spectroscopy to measure the transition path times for the association of two intrinsically disordered proteins that form a folded dimer upon binding and identify a metastable encounter complex.",

Here authors use single-molecule FRET to show that the lifetime of TC for IDP binding is very long due to the stabilization by non-native electrostatic interactions, which makes fast association possible.",
