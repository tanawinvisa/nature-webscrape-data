        "Summary": "The effectiveness of digital contact tracing for COVID-19 control remains uncertain. Here, the authors use data from the Smittestopp app, used in Norway in spring 2020, and estimate that 80% of nearby devices were detected by the app, and at least 11% of close contacts were not visible to manual contact tracing.",

Here the authors report the results of the multicentric phase III SEIPLUS trial, showing that EIPL does not improve 3-year survival rate in patients with advanced gastric cancer.",
