        "Summary": "Identifying abnormalities in medical images across different viewing angles and body parts is a time-consuming task. Deep learning techniques hold great promise for supporting radiologists and improving patient triage decisions. A new study tests the viability of such approaches in resource-limited settings, exploring the effect of pretraining, dataset size and choice of deep learning model in the task of abnormality detection in lower-limb radiographs.",

        "Summary": "Predicting the structure of proteins from amino acid sequences is a hard problem. Convolutional neural networks can learn to predict a map of distances between amino acid residues that can be turned into a three-dimensional structure. With a combination of approaches, including an evolutionary technique to find the best neural network architecture and a tool to find the atom coordinates in the folded structure, a pipeline for rapid prediction of three-dimensional protein structures is demonstrated.",
