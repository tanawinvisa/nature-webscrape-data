        "Summary": "The efficacy of carbapenem antibiotics can be compromised by metallo-\u03b2-lactamases, but a high-throughput screen followed by optimization has now enabled the discovery of indole-2-carboxylates (InCs) as potent broad-spectrum metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. The results highlight the potential of InC\u2013carbapenem combinations for clinical use as well as mechanism-guided approaches to combatting globally disseminated antibiotic resistant mechanisms.",
