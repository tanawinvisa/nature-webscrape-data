        "Summary": "Late-stage aromatic chlorination of active pharmaceutical ingredients has enormous potential in drug discovery yet still features limited applicability due to issues of functional-group tolerance. Now, dimethyl sulfoxide is reported as catalyst for the chlorination of a diverse family of bioactive molecules in combination with N-chlorosuccinimide.",

Subsequent structure\u2013activity optimization created a new antibacterial analogue with high potency against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including challenging persisters and biofilms, as well as demonstrating efficacy in an in vivo mouse model. The mode of action involves stimulation of protein secretion and inhibition of menaquinone biosynthesis.",
