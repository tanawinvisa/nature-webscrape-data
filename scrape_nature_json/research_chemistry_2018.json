        "Summary": "The use of electrochemistry in asymmetric catalysis can prove challenging, not least due to the difficulty of achieving chemo- and stereoselectivity in combination with very reactive electrochemically generated intermediates. Here, catalytic asymmetric electrosynthesis is reported for the synthesis of 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds with high enantiomeric excess, including compounds with all-carbon quaternary stereocentres. The chiral-at-metal catalyst activates the substrate towards anodic oxidation in addition to controlling the enantioselectivity of the process.",

        "Summary": "Reusable catalysts based on earth-abundant metals could offer inexpensive and sustainable routes in organic synthesis. Here a nickel catalyst\u2014formed by pyrolysis of a nickel complex on a \u03b3-Al2O3 support\u2014is shown to be highly active for synthesis of primary amines via reductive amination. The catalyst operates with aqueous ammonia and either aldehydes or ketones, tolerating a wide range of functional groups.",
