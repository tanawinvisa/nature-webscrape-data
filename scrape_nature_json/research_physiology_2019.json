        "Summary": "Hypothalamus is implicated in memory disorders but the neural mechanisms are unknown. Here, the authors report that MCH expressing hypothalamic neurons respond to novel object exposure, are inhibited by local GAD65 expressing neurons and these local circuit interactions are causally involved in object memory formation.",

Here, the authors analyse muscle biopsies from 119 patients with sarcopenia and age-matched controls of different ethnic groups and find transcriptional signatures indicating mitochondrial dysfunction, associated with reduced mitochondria numbers and lower NAD+\u2009levels in older individuals with sarcopenia.",
