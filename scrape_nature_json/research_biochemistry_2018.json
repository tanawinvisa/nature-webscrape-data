        "Summary": "Alkaline ceramidases (ACERs) are a class of poorly understood transmembrane enzymes controlling the homeostasis of ceramides. Here authors solve the Xray structure of human ACER3 and uncover a Ca2+ binding site providing an explanation for the known regulatory role of Ca2+ on ACER3 activity.",

        "Summary": "A 27\u2009kDa photosensitizer protein (PSP) has now been developed and used to design a miniature photocatalytic CO2-reducing enzyme. Visible light drives the PSP efficiently to the long-lived triplet excited state (PSP*), and then to a super-reducing radical (PSP\u2022), which is strong enough to reduce many CO2-reducing catalysts. The 3D structure of PSP\u2022 at 1.8\u2009\u00c5 resolution was determined by X-ray crystallography.",
