        "Link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01496-y",
        "Summary": "Cyclic peptides show promise for modulating difficult disease targets; however, they often cannot be administered orally. The authors developed a method to synthesize and screen large libraries of small cyclic peptides while enabling the simultaneous interrogation of activity and permeability. This approach was applied to the disease target thrombin to discover peptides with high affinity, stability and oral bioavailability of up to 18% in rats.",

Now an electrochemical strategy enables chemoselective labelling of proteins at a site-specifically incorporated 5-hydroxytryptophan residue using aromatic amines as coupling partners. This approach works on various proteins, including a full-length antibody, and is compatible with established click reactions.",
