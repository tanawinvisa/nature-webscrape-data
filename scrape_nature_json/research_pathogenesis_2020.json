Modulation of KDM6B can interchange the host response to non-invasive and invasive pneumococcal strains, demonstrating the biological role of KDM6B in cellular responses during infection.",

        "Summary": "Excessive interferon (IFN) responses often follow viral infection to induce pathology or even death. Here the authors show that a signaling adaptor, \u03b2-arrestin 2, enhances the cGAS/STING innate immunity signaling pathway to promote IFN-\u03b2 production, but may be degraded in infected cells to serve as a target of viral immune evasion.",

Here, the authors provide a comprehensive characterization of post mortem lung tissues of COVID-19 patients and find two distinct patterns characterized by differential expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which correlate to viral loads, cytokines, lung damage and time of hospitalization, suggesting ISG profiles to mark disease progression",
