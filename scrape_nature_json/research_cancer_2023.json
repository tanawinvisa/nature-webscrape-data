        "Summary": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes are associated with different molecular alterations and clinical outcomes, but they need to be characterised in diverse cohorts. Here, the authors perform genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling in a large cohort of Japanese RCC cases, and identify epi-subtypes associated with a particular immune environment.",
