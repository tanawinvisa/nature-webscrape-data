        "Summary": "Regulatory T (Treg) cells are developed in the thymus, and are essential for suppressing detrimental autoimmunity. Here the authors show, using mice with dampened interleukin 2 (IL-2) signaling, that IL-2 helps position the pioneer factor SATB1\u00a0to control genome-wide chromatin accessibility to facilitate Treg cell\u00a0lineage commitment in the thymus.",
