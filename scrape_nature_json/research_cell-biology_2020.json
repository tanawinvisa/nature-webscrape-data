        "Summary": "Muscle cells express an adhesion molecule called metavinculin, which has been associated with cardiomyopathies. Here, the authors employed molecular tension sensors to reveal that metavinculin expression modulates cell adhesion mechanics and they develop a mouse model to demonstrate\u00a0that the presence of metavinculin is not as critical for heart muscle function\u00a0as previously thought.",

        "Summary": "RIPK1 is a critical kinase which mediates necroptosis, apoptosis and inflammation. Regulation of RIPK1 by ubiquitination is being intensively investigated. Here, the authors made knock-in RIPK1-K612R mice and demonstrate that this mutation alters the RIPK1 ubiquitinylation pattern and inhibits its prodeath kinase activity in response to TNF\u03b1 but sensitizes cell death to TLRs signals.",
