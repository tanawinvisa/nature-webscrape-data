        "Summary": "Hypothalamic melanocortin neurons regulate systemic glucose homeostasis through incompletely understood pathways. Here, the authors show that a subset of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons innervate the liver via preganglionic parasympathetic cholinergic neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and that stimulation of this pathway elevates blood glucose levels",
