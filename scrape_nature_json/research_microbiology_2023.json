        "Summary": "N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) is an N4\u2010acetylcytidine (ac4C) writer, which catalyzes RNA acetylation at cytidine N4 position on RNAs. Here, the authors show that NAT10 catalyzes ac4C addition to a long non-coding RNA encoded by the oncogenic DNA virus Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), triggering viral lytic reactivation from latency, which promotes NAT10 recruitment of IFI16 mRNA, resulting in inflammasome activation.",

NDP52 forms a tripartite complex with Rab9 and envelope proteins of HBV and targets the virus to Rab9-dependent lysosomal degradation pathway.",
