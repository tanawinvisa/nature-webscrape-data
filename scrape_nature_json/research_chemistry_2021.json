        "Summary": "The systemic discovery of metal\u2013small-molecule complexes from biological samples is a difficult challenge. Now, a method based on liquid chromatography and native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has been developed. The approach uses post-column pH adjustment and metal infusion combined with ion identity molecular networking, and a rule-based informatics workflow, to interrogate small-molecule\u2013metal binding.",

Here the authors show a method to generate acyl radicals using only an organic photocatalyst and light, and these species are shown as competent nucleophiles in a variety of couplings.",
