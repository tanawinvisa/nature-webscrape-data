        "Summary": "SCCmec is a large mobile genetic element that confers resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Here, the authors show that biofilm growth conditions enhance the efficiency of natural transformation in S. aureus and allow the transfer of SCCmec to methicillin-sensitive strains.",
