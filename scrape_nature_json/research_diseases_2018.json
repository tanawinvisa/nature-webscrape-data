        "Summary": "The latent HIV-1 reservoir is the key obstacle for curing HIV-1\u00a0infection, but the timepoint at which the HIV-1 reservoir is established is currently unclear. Here, Whitney et al. show in non-human primates that the SIV reservoir in CD4+ T cells is seeded within the first 2 days after infection.",
