        "Summary": "Late-stage aromatic chlorination of active pharmaceutical ingredients has enormous potential in drug discovery yet still features limited applicability due to issues of functional-group tolerance. Now, dimethyl sulfoxide is reported as catalyst for the chlorination of a diverse family of bioactive molecules in combination with N-chlorosuccinimide.",
